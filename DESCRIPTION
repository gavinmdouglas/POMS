Description: This package is meant to aid researchers conduct
    exploratory data analysis of metagenomics sequencing data.
    The first step of POMS is always to identify significant nodes
    in a phylogenetic tree containing the taxa within the user's dataset.
    Enrichment tests are then run to test for enriched gene families on
    each side of each significant node.
