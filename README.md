This repository corresponds to the joint taxa-function analysis tool "Phylogenetic Organization of Metagenomic Signals" (POMS), which is described in this preprint:

[Gavin M. Douglas, Molly G. Hayes, Morgan G. I. Langille, Elhanan Borenstein. 2022. Integrating phylogenetic and functional data in microbiome studies. bioRxiv. doi: 10.1101/2022.02.21.480893.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.21.480893v1)

POMS is currently in beta: any feedback would be greatly appreciated! Please [open an issue](https://github.com/gavinmdouglas/POMS/issues) on this repository if you would like to ask a question or make a comment.

The POMS documentation is found on the [wiki site](https://github.com/gavinmdouglas/POMS/wiki).
