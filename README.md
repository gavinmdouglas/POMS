This repository corresponds to the joint taxa-function analysis tool Phylogenetic Organization of Metagenomic Signals (POMS), described in this preprint:

[Gavin M. Douglas, Molly G. Hayes, Morgan G. I. Langille, Elhanan Borenstein. 2022. Integrating phylogenetic and functional data in microbiome studies. bioRxiv. doi: 10.1101/2022.02.21.480893.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.21.480893v1)

This tool is for identifying functions (e.g., microbial gene families) that are encoded (or lacked) by disparate taxa that differ in abundance in the same sample direction. Such functions are referred to as consistently enriched functions, which could represent functions that are adaptive for many taxa in a given environment.

POMS is currently in beta: any feedback would be greatly appreciated! Please [open an issue](https://github.com/gavinmdouglas/POMS/issues) on this repository if you would like to ask a question or make a comment.

The POMS documentation is found on the [wiki site](https://github.com/gavinmdouglas/POMS/wiki).
