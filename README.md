# Phylogenetic Organization of Metagenome Signals (POMS)

This repository contains the code used for the joint taxa-function bioinformatics analysis tool described in Douglas et al. (_In Prep_).

The available POMS code is currently an **alpha release**, meaning that it is subject to major changes and is still being tested for bugs.
